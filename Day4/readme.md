# Day 4 slides
Plan A is that this lecture is delivered live. The slides are provided here so you can follow along. This lecture doesn't introduce too much new python, but is more intended to recap some of the things you've learned in other bits of the course, and show how they can be done in python to build up our automated registration tool.

# Day 4 practical

In this practical you will be building on what you did yesterday to automate the registration process, and extract some tumour regression information

Refer to the pdf in this folder for a set of reccomended steps, and some questions you should be able to answer at the end.
