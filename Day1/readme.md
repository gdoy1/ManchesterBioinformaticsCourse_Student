# Day 1 practical
This practical is done in the jupyter notebook you should find in this directory. To be able to run it, you will need to open a command window and navigate to this folder. Once here, run `jupyter notebook` and it should open up in your browser.

The instructions are in the notebook. This is just for exercise, and is not assessed. Don't worry if you finish it super quickly.
