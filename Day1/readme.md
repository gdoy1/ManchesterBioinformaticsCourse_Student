# Day 1 slides
There are no slides for this day, everything you need should have been covered in the pre-course work. There is however a cheatsheet with some tips for the assignment.

# Day 1 practical
This practical is done in the jupyter notebook you should find in this directory. To be able to run it, you will need to open a command window and navigate to this folder. Once here, run `jupyter notebook` and it should open up in your browser.

The instructions are in the notebook. This is just for exercise, and is __not assessed__. Don't worry if you finish it super quickly, it shouldn't be too difficult after you've done the pre-course work.
